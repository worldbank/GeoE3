## Checking Out the Code 🧩

### What You'll Learn

In this section, you'll learn how to clone the repository and prepare it for development.

### Steps

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the GEOE3 repository on GitHub.
2. **Clone Your Fork**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GEOE3.git
   ```

3. **Set Up the Plugin Path**:
   - Open QGIS.
   - Navigate to Plugins > Manage and Install Plugins > Settings > Plugin Paths.
   - Add the path to your local GEOE3 folder.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment 🛠️

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- QGIS 3.22 or later
- `pip` and `virtualenv`

### Steps

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

---

## Understanding `admin.py` 📜

The `admin.py` script provides various commands for managing the plugin, such as building, installing, and generating metadata.

### Key Commands

- **Build the Plugin**:

   ```bash
   python admin.py build
   ```

- **Install the Plugin**:

   ```bash
   python admin.py install
   ```

- **Generate Metadata**:

   ```bash
   python admin.py generate-metadata
   ```

---

## Debugging the Plugin 🐛

### Steps

1. **Enable Debugging in QGIS**:
   - Go to Settings > Options > System > Environment.
   - Add `PYTHONDEBUG=1`.
2. **Use Logs**:
   - Check the QGIS log panel for messages tagged with `GeoE3`.

## Making a Patch or Pull Request 🔄

### Steps

1. **Create a New Branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Changes and Commit**:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe your changes"
   ```

3. **Push and Create a Pull Request**:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Running Tests ✅

### Environment Variables

The test system requires the following environment variables:

- **`GEOE3_TEST_DIR`**: **Recommended** - Specifies the path to the test directory. This is automatically set by `scripts/start_qgis.sh` and `scripts/start_qgis_ltr.sh` to point to the project's test directory.
- **`GEEST_TEST_DIR`**: **Fallback** - Kept for backward compatibility.

**Important**: The plugin will fail to run tests if one of these environment variables is not set. Always use the provided startup scripts when developing.

### Steps

1. **Start QGIS with proper environment**:

   ```bash
   # Use one of these scripts to ensure proper environment setup
   ./scripts/start_qgis.sh
   # or
   ./scripts/start_qgis_ltr.sh
   ```

2. **Run Unit Tests from command line**:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

3. **Check Code Coverage**:

   ```bash
   pytest --cov=geoe3
   ```

4. **Run Tests from QGIS Plugin Interface**:
   - Use the "Run Tests" or "Run Single Test" buttons in developer mode
   - Tests will automatically use the `GEOE3_TEST_DIR` (or `GEEST_TEST_DIR` fallback) environment variable

---

## Tagging a Release 🏷️

### Steps

1. **Update `config.json`**:
   - Increment the version number.
2. **Create a Git Tag**:

   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
